My name is Connor Heath, and I'm a student at Oregon State University set to graduate in June 2024. I currently work for the Oregon State Baseball Analytics Team, and I'm passionate about sports analytics, statistics, data science, and engineering. I'd like to share with you a few of my projects, which are mainly based on Python and R. Each project has a ReadMe that explains the project and provides a guide to the work.
