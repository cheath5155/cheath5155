Hello,

My name is Connor Heath. I am currently a student at Oregon State University graduating in June 2024. I currently work for Oregon State Baseball's Analytics Team and have a passion for sports analytics, statistics, data science, and engineering. Below are repositories of a few projects I have undergone using mainly Python and R. Each of them should have a ReadMe which explains the project and a guide to the work.
